One paper is put on the arXiv: [Superfiltering: Weak-to-Strong Data Filtering for Fast Instruction-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00530), 
where we proposed a method for data selection in which the small GPT2 model can successfully filter out the high-quality subset form exsisting GPT4-generated instruction tuning dataset.  
Repo: [Superfiltering](https://github.com/tianyi-lab/Superfiltering).
