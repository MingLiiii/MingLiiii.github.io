One paper was put on the arXiv: [Mosaic IT: Enhancing Instruction Tuning with Data Mosaics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13326), where we proposed an augmentation method for instruction tuning, which concurrently **improves the LLM performances** and **lowers the training expenses**. Repo: [Mosaic-IT](https://github.com/tianyi-lab/Mosaic-IT).
