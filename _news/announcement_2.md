One paper is put on the arXiv: [From Quantity to Quality: Boosting LLM Performance with Self-Guided Data Selection for Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12032), where we proposed a **self-guided method** for data selection of instruction tuning which **does not need ANY extra outside models**, ranging from BERT to chatGPT. Repo: [Cherry_LLM](https://github.com/MingLiiii/Cherry_LLM).
