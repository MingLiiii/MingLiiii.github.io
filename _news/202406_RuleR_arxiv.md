One paper was put on the arXiv: [RuleR: Improving LLM Controllability by Rule-based Data Recycling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15938), where we proposed an augmentation method that incorporates multiple rule-based constraints into the original instruction data. Repo: [RuleR](https://github.com/MingLiiii/RuleR).
