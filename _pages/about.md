I am a **second-year Ph.D. student** in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/). 
I began my academic journey in computer science with a Bachelor of Science from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020, followed by a Master of Science at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html) advised by [Prof. Ruihong Huang](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/huangrh/index.html) in 2023. 
Besides, I spent 2 years at [Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science](http://english.siat.cas.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yu Qiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gFtI-8QAAAAJ) since 2019. 

My research interests broadly lie in the areas of Machine Learning (**ML**), Natural Language Processing (**NLP**), and Large Language Models (**LLM**). <br>
More specifically, my recent research interests mainly lie in 
1. **Instruction Tuning for LLMs**, including: <br>
**(i) Data Selection** ([Cherry LLM (IFD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12032), [Superfiltering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00530)); <br>
**(ii) Data Synthesis** ([Reflection-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11716), [Selective Reflection-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10110)); <br>
**(iii) Data Augmentation** ([Mosaic-IT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13326), [RuleR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15938)); <br>
**(iv) Controllability** ([DEBATunE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10614), [RuleR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15938)), and so on.<br>
2. **Interpretability of LLMs** ([Layer_Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23743)) <br>
3. **Finetuning for vision-LLMs** <br>
4. **LLM Agent** <br>
5. **RAG** <br>

**If you are looking for a highly motivated intern** with a background in computer science and a passion for advancing AI technologies, I would be thrilled to have an opportunity to chat with you!

I am really interested in collaboration, feel free to drop me an email for any opportunity!
