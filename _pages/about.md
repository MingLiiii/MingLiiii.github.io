I am a **first-year Ph.D. student** in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/). 
I began my academic journey in computer science with a Bachelor of Science from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020, followed by a Master of Science at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html) advised by [Prof. Ruihong Huang](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/huangrh/index.html) in 2023. 
Besides, I spent 2 years at [Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science](http://english.siat.cas.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yu Qiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gFtI-8QAAAAJ) since 2019. 

My research interests broadly lie in the areas of Machine Learning (**ML**), Natural Language Processing (**NLP**), and Large Language Models (**LLM**). 
More specifically, my recent research interests mainly lie in the alignment of LLMs, especially (1) **Fewer data for alignment**, i.e. designing methods to filter out the high-quality subset from the existing dataset automatically while obtaining comparable or even higher performance; (2) **Personalized agent tuning**, i.e. designing methods to tune LLM-based agents with persona/personalization; (3) **Interpretability on LLMs**, i.e. exploring why and how LLMs work. 

**If you are looking for a highly motivated intern** with a background in computer science and a passion for advancing AI technologies, I would be thrilled to have an opportunity to chat with you!

I am really interested in collaboration, feel free to drop me an email for any opportunity!
