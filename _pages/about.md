Welcome to my personal page! 

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/). 
I began my academic journey in computer science with a Bachelor of Science from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020, followed by a Master of Science at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html) advised by [Prof. Ruihong Huang](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/huangrh/index.html) in 2023. 
Besides, I spent 2 years at [Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science](http://english.siat.cas.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yu Qiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gFtI-8QAAAAJ) since 2019. 

My research interests broadly lie in the areas of Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLM). 
More specifically, my recent research interests mainly lie in the alignment of LLMs, especially (1) Data filtering for alignment, i.e. designing methods to filter out the high-quality subset from the existing dataset automatically while obtaining comparable or even higher performance; (2) Personalized agent tuning, i.e. designing methods to tune LLM-based agents with persona/personalization; (3) Interpretability on LLMs, i.e. exploring why and how LLMs work. 

I am looking for research interns!
