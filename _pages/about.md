I am a **third-year Ph.D. student** in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/). 
I began my academic journey in computer science with a Bachelor of Science from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020, followed by a Master of Science at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html) advised by [Prof. Ruihong Huang](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/huangrh/index.html) in 2023. 
Besides, I spent 2 years at [Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science](http://english.siat.cas.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yu Qiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gFtI-8QAAAAJ) since 2019. 

**If you are looking for a highly motivated intern** with a background in computer science and a passion for advancing AI technologies, I would be thrilled to have an opportunity to chat with you!

My research interests broadly lie in the areas of Machine Learning (**ML**), Natural Language Processing (**NLP**), and Large Language Models (**LLM**). <br>
More specifically, my recent research interests mainly lie in:<br>
(1). **Data-Centric AI**, including Data Synthesis and Selection: ([Cherry LLM (IFD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12032), [Superfiltering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00530),[Mosaic-IT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13326), [Selective Reflection-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10110));<br>
(2). **Interpretability**, including Training Effects and Response Analysis: ([Layer_Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23743),[Gradient_Unified](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10766), [MiP-Overthinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06514), [ThinkARM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19995));<br>
(3). **Human-AI Cognitive Alignment**: ([Difficulty Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18880), [Schoenfeld Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14662));<br>
(4). **AI for Education**: ([Item Difficulty Modeling](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00131644251344973), [Position: Student Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05473)).


I am really interested in collaboration, feel free to drop me an email for any opportunity!
